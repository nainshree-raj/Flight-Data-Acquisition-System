# Flight-Data-Acquisition-System
                        Design and Verification of Flight Data Acquisition System using UVM (Universal Verification Methodology).
                              
--> The objective : <br>
> To realize the parallel acquisition function of all kinds of flight data by using the parallel operation mode of FPGA.<br>
> To study and develop the data acquisition system  to acquire and store the data and analysis of the data.<br>
> To verify the system using sophisticated verification methodology-UVM.<br>

<br>
--> TOOLS USED (SOFTWARE /HARDWARE)<br>
• Linux<br>
• PuTTy software<br>
• Quartus Prime (Use Qsys (recently rebranded as Platform Designer) to instantiate and connect HPS 
components)<br>
• DE1-SoC (a robust hardware design platform built around the Altera System-on-Chip (SoC) FPGA, which 
combines the latest dual-core Cortex-A9 embedded cores with industry-leading programmable logic for 
ultimate design flexibility)<br>
• SDMMC card preloaded with default GSRD image
