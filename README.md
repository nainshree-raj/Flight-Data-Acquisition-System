# Flight-Data-Acquisition-System
         Design and Verification of Flight Data Acquisition System using UVM (Universal Verification Methodology).
                              
--> The objective : <br>
• To realize the parallel acquisition function of all kinds of flight data by using the parallel operation mode of FPGA.<br>
• To study and develop the data acquisition system  to acquire and store the data and analysis of the data.<br>
• To verify the system using sophisticated verification methodology-UVM.<br>

<br>
--> TOOLS USED (SOFTWARE /HARDWARE)<br>
• Linux<br>
• QuestaSim(UVM)<br>
• Quartus Prime (Designing the FDAU using System Verilog)<br>
• DE1-SoC (a robust hardware design platform built around the Altera System-on-Chip (SoC) FPGA, which 
combines the latest dual-core Cortex-A9 embedded cores with industry-leading programmable logic for 
ultimate design flexibility)<br>

--> Applications :
<br>
• Modern data acquisition technology uses real-time communication and advanced networks to monitor aircraft worldwide.<br>
• It is a process of converting real-world signals to the digital domain for display, storage, and analysis.<br>
• A flight data recorder (FDR), popularly known as a “Black Box” in aviation, is an electronic recording device in aircraft to facilitate the investigations of aviation accidents.<br>
• This allows flight data to be still relayed to crews and inspectors on the ground in the event of an accident.<br>
• The data recorded in the FDR is used to analyze the electronic systems of the aircraft for safety issues and the investigation of aircraft accidents.<br>
